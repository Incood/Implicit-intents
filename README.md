# Implicit-intents
The Implicit-Intents application registers for implicit intents that come from viewed links (URLs) with the scheme: http.

If it receives this intent, the application prints the incoming URI in TextView.Implicit-Intents is intended to be used in conjunction with the ImplicitIntents application, but will receive the corresponding implicit intent from any application (for example, a link in an email).
